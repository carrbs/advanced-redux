## Backend API

Our API is built using [Loopback.js](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback)
To see all of the available REST API endpoints take a look at the explorer [localhost:3000/explorer](localhost:3000/explorer)

Below are the main API endpoints you will use for this app

## To start development

To seed the database for the first time

```
npm run seed
```
then run

```bash
npm start
```

This will create a .env file in the root directory and start the default gulp
task.

The default gulp task will

* Compile stylus files to css.
* Compile React app with WebPack
* Launch nodemon which will intern manage the LoopBack server
* Launch `webpack-dev-server` with Hot Reloading and React Hot Loader
* Launch BrowserSync which will manage injecting css and webpack build
